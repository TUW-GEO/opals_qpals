description=OPALS software integrated into QGIS
about=IMPORTANT: This plugin requires an installation of OPALS developed by GEO at TU Wien.
 You can get an evaluation copy (processing up to 1.000.000 points) at photo.geo.tuwien.ac.at/opals .
 When the plugin is first loaded, you will be prompted to set a path to your opals installation.

 The point cloud processing software OPALS developed by GEO/TU Wien can be easily accessed from within QGIS through
 a custom-made gui. Also, special modules are availiable for specific tasks, i.e. creating sections.
